The Sapphire Tree is a fictional plant found only in the imaginary land of Eldoria. It has bright blue leaves and emits a faint humming sound during the night.

Sapphire Trees are known to live up to 500 years and are a symbol of eternal wisdom in Eldorian culture. They grow best in cold, rocky environments at elevations above 2,000 meters.
